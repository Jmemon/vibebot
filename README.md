# X API Bot Generator Platform Build Plan

## Overview

This project creates an ecosystem of specialized bots that can capture and reflect distinct "vibes" from different corners of social media. Starting from zero bots, we build a scalable system that learns from engagement patterns and evolves over time.

## How It Works

### Stage 1: Small Bot Creation

We begin by building small bots with limited parameter counts (around 500M parameters). Each bot is initialized with:

* A curated timeline/data stream composed of specific accounts to follow
* The ability to consume and process content from these sources

These bots are continuously trained using PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques. The training process leverages RL (Reinforcement Learning) based on reward signals constructed from post engagement metrics:
* Likes
* Retweets
* Shares
* Comments

We may also pull down posts from users to train on, making sure to de-personalize them to avoid regurgitating content specific to individual users.

When successful, these models develop internal representations of the data distribution within specific social media niches.

### Stage 2: Reverse Distillation

Once we have multiple successful small bots, we reverse-distill their knowledge into larger models. This is accomplished by:

1. Generating datasets from the smaller bots' outputs
2. Training larger models on these composite datasets
3. Creating multiple larger models for different subsets of the bot ecosystem

These larger models require less frequent training, though they will need periodic retraining to maintain their perspective on evolving data distributions.

### Stage 3: Ongoing Vibe Capture

The "vibe capture" happens primarily at the level of the smaller bots. They continuously train and generate content based on posts from their dedicated timelines. This design makes them more sensitive to changes in their local data distributionâ€”essentially, more sensitive to shifting "vibes" in their corner of the social media landscape.

These larger models can later be used to spin up new bots more easily, creating a virtuous cycle of bot creation and specialization.

## Applications

This ecosystem could be used for:
- Tracking emerging trends across different communities
- Creating engaging content that resonates with specific audiences
- Understanding shifting language patterns and cultural references
- Analyzing how information spreads across different social contexts
